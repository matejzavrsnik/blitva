# Blitva C# tools

Blitva is a (tiny) collection of C# tools. I needed them for something and wrote it in a way that could be of help to someone else. Builds into dll. Visual Studio 2008 project files are included for convenience.

## Currently implemented:
* Ahnentafel list
* Heap
  * MinHeap
  * MaxHeap
  * MidHeap (Yeah!)
* Fisher-Yates shuffling

## Usage
Add existing project Blitva to your solution. Add new reference to the C# project, that will use Blitva classes. Include "using Blitva" declaration in file, that will use them.

## Licensing
Blitva is distributed under MIT licence as stated on http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT, which is very permissive. You can do anything you like with this code. Commercial use is allowed. See LICENCE file for details.
